User Management API 


Server, along with API, and DB operations

The database that we will be using is mongoDB and the database
aggregator would be mongodb atlas 



createAccount  -> data
login           -> data
route           -> data

in order to control what kind of data do we require and hence 
what kind of data is ALLOWED on our Server
hack, crash, conflict 

email -> Vishoo Verma
name -> vishooverma@gmail.com 


createAccount -> Name, email, password, phone number etc 
login -> email, password 

Data Validation -> mongoose -> data object modelling tool, validate Data
it is used to connect our server to our database





MVC Architecture -> Scalablity 
project structure architecture 
implement CODE ON DEMAND feature 
rendering lesser lines of code saves processing power of our server
